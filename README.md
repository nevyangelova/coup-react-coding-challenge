This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
It serves the purpose of an interview coding challenge.

## Description of coding challenge

1. Run **npm install** to update dependencies
2. Run **npm start** to start application in development mode
3. *Note: test coverage is currently not implemented*
4. *Note: Maps API is currently not implemented, but if more time was given I found an easy way to do this with https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial*

## Known issues while implementing

1. Having started the application as a whole, without breaking it down into simple features. Might have had more time to add the Maps feature.
2. Couldn't figure out the issues with the test setup (after some investigation found out it might be a compiler issue and having a custom one locally might work).
3. Found a bug with the filters that I didn't catch on time, when you change the model, after filters have been applied once, it doesn't load the scooters.
4. Third-party components used include small UI enhancement components from npm like 'rc-slider' which I like using in my applications to enhance the user experience and where custom implementation isn't needed.
5. Combine development time - 4-5h.
